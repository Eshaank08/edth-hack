**Option A: Google Colab (Recommended)**
```bash
# Upload train_elite.py to Colab along with:
# - elite_features.py
# - elite_model.py
# - data_augmentation.py
# Then run training (takes ~45-60 min on GPU)
```

**Option B: Local (if you have good GPU)**
```bash
python train_elite.py
# Takes ~4-6 hours on CPU, ~1 hour on GPU
# Uses ~5-6 GB RAM
```

### Step 2: Run Elite Bot

## ⚡ Speed vs Accuracy Trade-off

The elite system uses TTA which takes longer (~1.5-2.5s vs ~0.5s).

**But:** Higher accuracy = more correct answers = higher total score!

| System | Inference | Accuracy | Speed Bonus | Total/Challenge |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Advanced (no TTA) | 0.5s | 86% | ~95 pts | ~195 x 0.86 = **168** |
| Elite (with TTA) | 2.0s | 91% | ~85 pts | ~185 x 0.91 = **168** |
| **Elite optimized** | **1.5s** | **91%** | **~90 pts** | **~190 x 0.91 = 173** |

**Winner:** Elite optimized! 🏆

---

## 🎮 Configuration Options

### In `competition_bot_elite.py`:

```python
# Line 22-23: TTA settings
USE_TTA = True  # Set False for faster inference (but lower accuracy)
TTA_VOTING = "soft"  # "soft" (average probs) or "hard" (majority vote)
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Maximum Accuracy:** `USE_TTA = True` ✅
- **Maximum Speed:** `USE_TTA = False`
- **Balanced:** `USE_TTA = True` with fewer augmentations (edit `data_augmentation.py`)

| Method | Time | RAM | Cost | Best For |
|--------|------|-----|------|----------|
| **Google Colab Free** | 60 min | 0 (cloud) | $0 | Most users ✅ |
| **Laptop CPU** | 6 hrs | ~6 GB | $0 | Overnight |

## 📋 Complete Workflow

### Phase 1: Train Elite Model (60-90 min)

```bash
# Verify everything is ready
python verify_setup.py

# Option A: Colab (recommended)
# 1. Upload train_elite.py to Colab
# 2. Upload: elite_features.py, elite_model.py, data_augmentation.py
# 3. Run all cells
# 4. Download best_model_elite.pt

# Option B: Local
python train_elite.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
Epoch 50/100
Train Acc: 0.9345
Val Acc: 0.9123  ← Target: >0.90
✓ Saved best model
```

### Phase 2: Test Locally (10 min)

```bash
# Run bot for a few challenges to verify
python competition_bot_elite.py
# Watch for 10 challenges, check accuracy and scores
# Ctrl+C to stop
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Score Awarded: 192
✓ Score Awarded: 188
✓ Score Awarded: 195
Stats: 9/10 correct (90%)
🔥 Average score per correct: 191.2
```

### Phase 3: Deploy 24/7 (Ongoing)

```bash
# Run in background
nohup python competition_bot_elite.py > elite_bot.log 2>&1 &

# Monitor
tail -f elite_bot.log
```

---

## 🏆 Optimization Tips

### 1. **Ensemble Multiple Models**
Train 3-5 elite models with different random seeds:
```bash
python train_elite.py  # Model 1
# Change random seed in code
python train_elite.py  # Model 2
# Repeat...
```

Then modify `competition_bot_elite.py` to load all models and vote.

**Expected gain:** +2-3% accuracy

### 2. **Fine-tune on Errors**
After running for a while:
1. Save all mistakes (wrong predictions)
2. Augment those samples heavily
3. Fine-tune model on them

**Expected gain:** +1-2% accuracy on hard cases

### 3. **Optimize TTA**
Instead of 5 augmentations, try:
- 3 augmentations (faster, still good)
- Only pitch shift (fastest augmentation)
- Dynamic TTA (only if confidence < 0.95)

**Expected gain:** Faster inference, same accuracy

### 4. **Use GPU if Available**
Even a cheap GPU (GTX 1060, RTX 2060) will:
- Train 5x faster
- Infer 3x faster
- Allow TTA without speed penalty

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Out of Memory" during training
**Solution 1:** Use Google Colab (recommended)
**Solution 2:** Reduce batch size in `train_elite.py` line 24:
```python
PHYSICAL_BATCH_SIZE = 4  # or even 2
```

### Low accuracy (< 90%)
**Possible causes:**
- Not enough training epochs
- Bad random seed
- Data augmentation too aggressive

**Solutions:**
- Train longer (increase patience)
- Train 2-3 times, keep best
- Reduce AUGMENTATION_PROB to 0.4

### Inference too slow (> 3s)
**Solutions:**
- Set `USE_TTA = False` in `competition_bot_elite.py`
- Reduce TTA augmentations in `data_augmentation.py`
- Use GPU

### Model not found
```bash
# Check file exists
ls -lh models/best_model_elite.pt

# Should be ~1-2 MB (larger than advanced model)
# If not, train first:
python train_elite.py
```
