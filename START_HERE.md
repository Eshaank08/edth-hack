## 🎯 Three-Step Success Path

### Step 1: Test (1 minute)
```bash
make test
# OR: uv run python test_api.py
```
Verifies API connection and credentials.

### Step 2: Quick Model (10 seconds)
```bash
make quick
# OR: uv run python train_baseline_quick.py
```
Creates a baseline model for immediate testing.

### Step 3: Compete! (Continuous)
```bash
make compete
# OR: uv run python competition_bot.py
```
Starts competing automatically. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

## 📈 Want Higher Scores?

The quick baseline gets you started, but for serious competition:

```bash
# 1. Download full dataset (see COMPETITION_GUIDE.md)
curl -L -o data.zip https://github.com/helsing-ai/edth-munich-drone-acoustics/releases/download/train_val_data/drone_acoustics_train_val_data.zip
unzip data.zip && mkdir -p data/raw && mv train data/raw/ && mv val data/raw/

# 2. Train real model (20 minutes)
make train
# OR: uv run python train_model.py

# 3. Compete with better accuracy
make compete
```

**Baseline**: ~33% accuracy, ~130 pts/challenge  
**Trained**: ~75% accuracy, ~175 pts/challenge

## 🎓 Understanding The Files

### Core Competition Files
- `competition_bot.py` ⭐ - **THE BOT** - Run this to compete
- `train_model.py` - Full model training (requires dataset)
- `train_baseline_quick.py` - Quick test model (no dataset needed)

### Helper Scripts  
- `test_api.py` - API connectivity test
- `setup_and_run.py` - Interactive setup wizard
- `quick_start.sh` - Bash quick start script

### Documentation
- `START_HERE.md` - You are here!
- `SUMMARY.md` - Complete system overview

## 🏆 Competition Strategy

### Phase 1: Test (5 min)
- Run quick baseline
- See how the bot works
- Understand the system

### Phase 2: Train (30 min)
- Download full dataset
- Train real model
- Achieve 70-85% accuracy

### Phase 3: Compete (Continuous)
- Start the bot
- Let it run 24/7
- Monitor leaderboard
- Improve model as needed

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Can't find `make` command?
Use the Python scripts directly:
```bash
uv run python train_baseline_quick.py
uv run python competition_bot.py
```

### `uv: command not found`?
Install uv:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Bot not working?
1. Check API: `make test`
2. Verify model exists: `make status`
3. Check logs for errors
4. Ensure internet connection

### Low scores?
- Quick baseline has low accuracy (~33%)
- Download dataset and train full model for better results
- See `COMPETITION_GUIDE.md` for improvement tips

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start small**: Use quick baseline first to test
2. **Monitor live**: Watch at https://edth.helsing.codes/static/index.html
3. **Keep running**: Bot works 24/7, don't stop it
4. **Train properly**: Full dataset = much better accuracy
5. **Iterate**: Improve model while bot runs

---

## 🎯 Your Next Command

If you haven't already:

```bash
make quick
```

Or:

```bash
uv run python train_baseline_quick.py && uv run python competition_bot.py
```

**That's all you need to start competing!** 🚀

---

## 📞 Need More Help?

- **Quick overview**: Read `SUMMARY.md`
- **Detailed guide**: Read `COMPETITION_GUIDE.md`
- **Visual flows**: Read `WORKFLOW.md`
- **All commands**: Run `make help`
- **Check status**: Run `make status`

---

## ✅ System Check

Run this to see if you're ready:

```bash
make status
```

It will show:
- ✅ Virtual environment status
- ✅ Dataset status
- ✅ Model status
- ✅ Ready to compete?

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Everything is configured with your credentials and ready to compete.

**Three commands to remember:**
1. `make test` - Test everything
2. `make quick` - Quick start
3. `make compete` - Start competing

**Or just one command:**
```bash
make quick
```

**Good luck! May your model be accurate and your latency be low! 🏆🚀**
