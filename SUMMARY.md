## 🎮 How to Use (3 Options)

### Option 1: Super Quick Test (2 minutes)
```bash
# Create quick baseline model
uv run python train_baseline_quick.py

# Start competing immediately
uv run python competition_bot.py
```
**Use this to**: Test the system, learn how it works

### Option 2: Full Competition (30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Download dataset (10 min)
curl -L -o data.zip https://github.com/helsing-ai/edth-munich-drone-acoustics/releases/download/train_val_data/drone_acoustics_train_val_data.zip
unzip data.zip
mkdir -p data/raw
mv train data/raw/
mv val data/raw/

# 2. Train model (20 min)
uv run python train_model.py

# 3. Start competing
uv run python competition_bot.py
```
**Use this for**: Actual competition, high scores

### Option 3: Automated (Easy Mode)
```bash
# One command does everything
uv run python setup_and_run.py
```
**Use this if**: You want guidance through the process

Time until rotation: 95.2s
============================================================
Downloading audio...
Download completed in 0.83s
Classifying audio...
Prediction: drone (confidence: 0.847)
Classification completed in 0.12s
Submitting prediction: drone

============================================================
Result: Correct!
✓ Score Awarded: 195
✓ Total Score: 195
Total time: 1.02s
Stats: 1/1 correct (100.0%)
============================================================
```

**The bot runs continuously, competing on every challenge!**

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### Step 1: Test API (1 minute)
```bash
uv run python test_api.py
```
Verifies everything is connected and working.

### Step 2: Quick Test (2 minutes)
```bash
uv run python train_baseline_quick.py
uv run python competition_bot.py
```
See the bot in action, get familiar with the system.

### Step 3: Real Competition (30 minutes setup, then continuous)
```bash
# Download dataset (once)
uv run python setup_and_run.py

# OR manually:
uv run python train_model.py
uv run python competition_bot.py
```

Let it run! The bot will compete 24/7 if you want.

### Step 4: Improve (Optional)
- Edit `train_model.py`
- Try different features
- Bigger models
- Train new model
- Restart bot with better model
