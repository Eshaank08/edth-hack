## 🚀 Keep Bot Running Continuously

### Option 1: Simple Script
```bash
./run_bot_continuous.sh
```

### Option 2: Direct Command
```bash
cd /Users/eshaan/Downloads/edth-munich-drone-acoustics
/Users/eshaan/.local/bin/uv run python competition_bot.py
```

The bot will:
- Poll every 2 seconds
- Process each new challenge (every 100s)
- Submit automatically
- Show real-time stats
- Run until you stop it (Ctrl+C)

## 📈 Current Status

**First Test Results:**
- ✅ Bot initialized successfully
- ✅ Challenge downloaded in 0.32s
- ✅ Classification took 1.31s
- ✅ Total submission time: 1.71s
- ✅ Submitted to API successfully
- 📝 Prediction: helicopter (baseline model - expected low accuracy)

**Note:** The quick baseline model has low accuracy (~33%). This is expected!

## 🏆 To Improve Scores

For better accuracy, download the full dataset and train:

```bash
# 1. Download dataset
curl -L -o data.zip https://github.com/helsing-ai/edth-munich-drone-acoustics/releases/download/train_val_data/drone_acoustics_train_val_data.zip

# 2. Extract
unzip data.zip
mkdir -p data/raw
mv train data/raw/
mv val data/raw/

# 3. Train full model (20 min)
/Users/eshaan/.local/bin/uv run python train_model.py

# 4. Restart bot (will use new model)
./run_bot_continuous.sh
```

**Expected improvement:**
- Baseline: ~33% accuracy
- Trained: ~75% accuracy
- Better accuracy = more points!
